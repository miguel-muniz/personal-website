# Personal Website <small>`v2.0`</small>

My personal website, https://miguel-muniz.com/, showcases my own personal work, career, and skills. It also serves as a platform to experiment and publish written content.

It is currently in the process of an overhaul, as my old website has served its purpose but is in dire need of an update to reflect all the knowledge I have gained now that I am years into my career.

## Building
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. After dependencies are installed, run `gulp`
4. A development server will be started and the website will load in your default browser
