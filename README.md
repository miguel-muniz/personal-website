# Personal Website

My personal website, https://miguel-muniz.com/, showcases my own personal work, career, and skills. It also serves as a platform to experiment and publish written content.

It is currently in the process of an overhaul, as my old website has served it's purpose but is in dire need of an update to reflect all the knowledge I have gained now that I am a few years into my career.
